# Sticker Generator (Telegram Bot)

**Sticker Generator** is an AI-powered Telegram bot that generates high-quality artistic stickers from text descriptions using the **Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3)** model.

---
## Features
- **Generate Stickers from Text Descriptions:** Create custom stickers by simply describing what you want.
- **Multiple Art Styles:** Choose from various art styles or use prompt templates for consistent results.
- **Add Text Captions:** Personalize your stickers with custom text captions.
- **High-Quality Downloads:** Download generated stickers as high-quality PNG files.

##  Research Contribution

###  Advanced Prompt Engineering
We designed and refined custom prompts for 10+ art styles (e.g., pastel, anime, oil painting).  
Through experimentation, we found that **reference-based prompts** consistently produced more coherent and visually appealing outputs compared to generic adjective-based prompts.

###  Comparative Analysis
We conducted side-by-side evaluations of outputs generated by:  
1. Direct prompts sent to SD3.  
2. Optimized prompts via our Telegram bot.  

Our results showed that the botâ€™s **hidden optimization layer** produced **significantly better outputs** in all the styles, highlighting the role of engineered prompts in text-to-image generation.

## Requirement
The project uses the collab file provided by user camenduru on github to access the stable diffusion 3 model notebook environment as it consumes less GPU power.

The project starts by cloning a specific branch of the repository from GitHub (totoro2 branch from the camenduru/ComfyUI repo). This repository contains the necessary codebase and configuration to work with the Stable Diffusion model
