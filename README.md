# Sticker Generator (Telegram Bot)

**Sticker Generator** is an AI-powered Telegram bot that generates high-quality artistic stickers from text descriptions using the **Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3)** model.

---
## Features
- **Generate Stickers from Text Descriptions:** Create custom stickers by simply describing what you want.
- **Multiple Art Styles:** Choose from various art styles or use prompt templates for consistent results.
- **Add Text Captions:** Personalize your stickers with custom text captions.
- **High-Quality Downloads:** Download generated stickers as high-quality PNG files.

## Key Insights

### Advanced Prompt Engineering
- Designed and refined custom prompts for 10+ art styles (e.g., pastel, anime, oil painting).  
- Found that reference-based prompts consistently produced more coherent and visually appealing outputs compared to generic adjective-based prompts.  

### Comparative Analysis
- Conducted side-by-side evaluations of outputs generated by:  
  - Direct prompts sent to SD3.  
  - Optimized prompts via our Telegram bot.  
- Results showed that the bot’s hidden optimization layer produced significantly better outputs across all styles, highlighting the role of engineered prompts in text-to-image generation.
